My task was to write java code and create Park class with 8 private fields, which discribe that class precisely, with getters and setters for them. Also I had to create 1 static, 2 private fields and constructors: default, with 4 parameters and with all parameters. And special methods such as toString(), printField(), printStaticField()(are printing my static field) and resetValues() also were required.

To run my code:
1. Please make java (11 version) project in your IDE and in src foulder create ua.iot.lviv.parks package.
2. To that package download my Main and Park java files.
3. Being in that folder type in terminal "javac Main.java" and then "java Main"
